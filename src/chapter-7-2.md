### Monitor AI Performance

It's important to monitor the performance of AI systems to identify any errors or biases. Regular testing and evaluation can help identify issues before they become problematic.

### Establish Clear Accountability

To ensure accountability for AI decision making, it's important to establish clear lines of responsibility and assign accountability for decisions made by AI systems.

### Ensure Transparency

To ensure transparency in AI decision making, it's important to provide explanations for decisions made by AI systems. This can help build trust and understanding among stakeholders.

Ensuring Compliance
